# Project 0x1B. C - Binary Tree

## Description
This project involves learning about the following concepts:
 * What is a binary tree.
 * What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists.
 * What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree.
 * What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree.
 * What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.

## Compilation
* Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

## Header File
* `binary_trees.h` will include all the prototypes of the functions.
